Have you made any changes to the data to enable further analysis? Remember to describe what you did for every column in the data. \n\nThe original dataset has 879 rows and 9 columns. In the process of following the description, the sales column was converted to numeric by removing the comma and the dollar sign. The next step was the removal of rows not needed for the analysis. The rows that do not contain dogs, cats, fish and bird in the pet type column were dropped. This meant that 46 rows were dropped with 833 rows left. There are no duplicate rows or missing values in the dataset so no values were removed again. The remaining columns have:\n\n1. There are 879 unique product identifiers\n2. There are 11 product categories as stated\n3. There are 5 pet sizes\n4. The pet type have been reduced to 4 pet types\n5. Rating is on a 10-point scale\n6.

In your description you should:\n- Include at least two different data visualizations to demonstrate the characteristics of single variables\n- Include at least one data visualization to demonstrate the relationship between two or more variables\n- Describe how your analysis has answered the business questions in the project brief\n\n## How many products are being purchased more than once?\nThere are 390 products that were purchased more than once. The most repurchased product category is equipment, which is closely followed by the snack products and toy products. This would indicate that the marketing team should consider equipment and snack products to include in their list of products.\n\n![Plot showing number of product purchased once and more than once](Plot_1_1.png)\n\n![Plot showing the product category for repurchased products](Plot_1_2.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?\nThe products purchased once have higher total sales (51125000 dollars) compared to products that were purchased more than once (45587000 dollars). However, products purchased more than once have higher average sales compared to products purchased once. Products in the category of Snacks, toys and supplements that were purchased once have higher total sales than those that were purchased more than once. This could be due to the large prices of these products. The marketing team may want to include these onetime purchase products in their list.\n![Plot showing total sales for products repurchased once or more than once](Plot_2_1.png)\n\n![Plot showing sales by products category and repurchased once or more than once](Plot_2_2.png)\n\n## What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?\nThe products that have been purchased more than once are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets. For pet dogs and cats, products such equipment, food, medicine, toys and snacks are more likely to be purchased again. Equipment products, snacks and toys are more likely to be repurchased for fish pets. Pet birds have only three possible products that are more likely to be purchased again, these are equipment, toys and snack products. Based on this, equipment products, toy products and snack products should be added to the list of product subscription as they are more likely to be purchased again by customers.\n\n![Plot showing count of pet types for products purchased more than once](Plot_3.png)\n\n![Plot showing the Sales by pet type](Plot_3_1.png)\n\nBased on the analysis results, for both product bought once and products repurchased, products in the equipment, toys and snack category are popular among customers as they are the most purchased and bring in the most sales. It is advised that such products be included in the pet box subscription list as they are more likely to be purchased again. Cats and Dogs pet products have the highest sales and the highest number of purchases and should be targeted by the marketing team. Further research should be done to understand customer preferences and other factors that affect product repurchase. The analysis also showed that products purchased once had higher sales in total and higher sales in more categories compared to repurchased products. The marketing team are recommended to include certain products purchased only once in the subscription list.\n\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"714a7083-7a43-4b0b-8ed4-2675efc87691","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
